# Boldify First Two Letters Chrome Extension

## Overview

This Chrome extension automatically bolds the first two characters of each word on English-language web pages. The idea is inspired by the concept of "Bionic Reading," which some people claim can increase reading speed and comprehension by visually emphasizing the beginning of words.

## Bionic Reading Claim

Bionic Reading is a reading method that highlights the initial letters of words, supposedly allowing the brain to recognize and process words faster. While some users report increased reading speed and focus, scientific evidence is limited and results may vary from person to person.
